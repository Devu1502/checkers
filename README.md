In this project, I worked on implementing a Checkers game using bitboard representation and bitwise methods. The goal was to create a simple, efficient version of Checkers where moves and game states are represented in binary.
This code runs the core game rules, such as piece movement, capturing, and winning conditions. The implementation uses binary numbers and bitwise operations to represent the board state and manipulate pieces, making data manipulation quick.
